abstract = {The Video Game Industry (VGI) is a highly innovative and rapidly growing sector that has become the dominant force in the entertainment industry, with significant economic and social implications. Despite the increasing attention that scholars and practitioners have paid to the VGI, the literature remains fragmented and lacks a coherent framework for understanding its complex nature and underlying dynamics. To address this gap, this study provides a comprehensive review of the extant VGI research, focusing on the business and management perspective this industry, and synthesizes the key components and concepts into an integrative evidence-based framework. Drawing on a sample of 84 articles published over the last 15 years in leading business and management journals, our framework maps the key elements of the VGI literature and establishes their conceptual relationships. Additionally, we identify critical gaps in the VGI research and suggest future research trajectories to guide scholars in advancing the field. Furthermore, we offer a set of practical implications for managers based on our findings. By providing a systematic and holistic understanding of the VGI, this study contributes to the development of a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective on this important and dynamic industry.}

 abstract = {A growth model for the timing of initial purchase of new products is developed and tested empirically against data for eleven consumer durables. The basic assumption of the model is that the timing of a consumer's initial purchase is related to the number of previous buyers. A behavioral rationale for the model is offered in terms of innovative and imitative behavior. The model yields good predictions of the sales peak and the timing of the peak when applied to historical data. A long-range forecast is developed for the sales of color television sets.},

 abstract = {Since the publication of the Bass model in 1969, research on the modeling of the diffusion of innovations has resulted in a body of literature consisting of several dozen articles, books, and assorted other publications. Attempts have been made to reexamine the structural and conceptual assumptions and estimation issues underlying the diffusion models of new product acceptance. The authors evaluate these developments for the past two decades. They conclude with a research agenda to make diffusion models theoretically more sound and practically more effective and realistic.},

 abstract = {W. C. Allee brought attention to the possibility of a positive relationship between aspects of fitness and population size over fifty years ago. This phenomenon, frequently termed the Allee effect, has been the focus of increased interest over the past two decades in the light of concerns over conservation and the problems of rarity. Use of the term suffers from the absence of a clear definition however, with the result that Allee effects are frequently thought to involve only a narrow range of phenomena and are often overlooked altogether. We propose a definition for the effect and attempt to resolve the major issues underlying the confusion surrounding this term.},
