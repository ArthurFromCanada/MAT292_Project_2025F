\section{Motivation and Objectives}
"The Video Game Industry (VGI) is a highly innovative and rapidly growing 
sector [...] with significant economic and social implications. [Yet] the 
literature remains fragmented and lacks a coherent framework for 
understanding its complex nature and underlying dynamics." \cite{Goh2023} 
We find that predicting gamer population over time can apply our research 
of the interplay between technological advancements, affordability, 
accessibility, and sociocultural trends.\\

\noindent Our objective is to develop a mathematical prediction model using 
differential equations to illustrate how the gamer population changes over 
time due to various factors. Beyond simply numerical estimation, we aim to 
explore the involvment of emerging technologies (i.e. VR, cloud gaming, or 
quantum computing) in accelerating growth or leading to new technological 
trends.
