\section{Motivation and Objectives}
"The Video Game Industry (VGI) is a highly innovative and rapidly growing 
sector [...] with significant economic and social implications. [Yet] the 
literature remains fragmented and lacks a coherent framework for 
understanding its complex nature and underlying dynamics." \cite{Goh2023} 
We find that predicting gamer population over time can apply our research 
of the interplay between technological advancements, affordability, 
accessibility, and market saturation.\\

\noindent Our goal is to develop a differential equation-based prediction
model to illustrate how the gamer population changes over time due to
factors such as technological advances, affordability, accessibility, and
market saturation. Beyond simple numerical estimations, we aim to 
explore the involvement of emerging technologies (i.e. VR, cloud gaming, or 
quantum computing) in accelerating growth or leading to new technological 
trends.
